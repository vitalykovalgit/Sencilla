# Technical Product Pricing


## Initial Assessment

Before recommending pricing, understand:

1. **Product type**: API/platform, developer tool, SaaS application, infrastructure?
2. **Current pricing**: What do you charge now? How long has it been this way?
3. **GTM motion**: Self-serve, sales-assisted, enterprise, or hybrid?
4. **Cost structure**: What's your marginal cost per customer/user/unit?
5. **Competitive landscape**: What do alternatives cost? (Including "do nothing")

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The Price Increase Nobody Noticed (You're Probably Underpriced)

**The Pattern:**

Platform company, growth stage. Pricing hadn't changed since launch. Enterprise customers paying $15K/year for a product saving them $200K+ in engineering time.

Leadership debate: "If we raise prices, we'll lose customers."

**What actually happened:**

Raised enterprise tier from $15K to $45K/year. Added dedicated support, SSO, audit logs to justify the jump.

Lost: 0 enterprise customers. Zero.

Gained: 3x revenue per enterprise account. Plus the customers who stayed started taking the product more seriously — higher adoption, more internal champions, more expansion.

**Why This Happens:**

Technical founders anchor pricing to cost ("it costs us $X to serve them, so we charge $2X"). Enterprise buyers anchor pricing to value ("this saves us $200K, so $45K is cheap").

**The Pricing Sanity Check:**

For every customer segment, calculate:

```
Value Ratio = Customer's alternative cost / Your price

If Value Ratio > 10x → You're massively underpriced
If Value Ratio > 5x  → You're underpriced (most startups are here)
If Value Ratio 3-5x  → Healthy pricing
If Value Ratio < 3x  → Approaching ceiling
If Value Ratio < 2x  → You're expensive (need strong differentiation)
```

**How to Calculate Alternative Cost:**

- Hours spent on manual process × hourly rate × frequency
- Cost of building in-house (engineers × months × loaded cost)
- Cost of existing tool + switching cost + productivity loss during transition
- Cost of *not solving the problem* (incidents, downtime, churn)

**Common Mistake:**

Comparing your price to competitors instead of to customer's alternative cost. Competitors anchor you to a race to the bottom. Value anchors you to what the customer actually saves.

### 2. The Three Pricing Models (And When Each Breaks)

**Model 1: Seat-Based ($X/user/month)**

**Works when:**
- Value scales with number of users (collaboration tools, communication)
- Usage is relatively uniform across users
- You want predictable revenue

**Breaks when:**
- Power users and casual users get same price (casual users churn)
- Product value doesn't scale with seats (one admin configures for 1,000 users)
- Customers consolidate seats to reduce cost (usage goes up, revenue doesn't)

**Model 2: Usage-Based ($X/unit)**

**Works when:**
- Usage varies significantly by customer (API calls, compute, storage)
- Marginal cost is meaningful (you need usage to track with revenue)
- Value directly correlates with usage

**Breaks when:**
- Customers can't predict bills (sticker shock at month-end)
- Low-usage customers aren't worth supporting
- High-usage customers negotiate volume discounts that compress margins

**Model 3: Outcome-Based ($X/result)**

**Works when:**
- You can measure outcomes reliably (leads generated, tickets resolved, code deployed)
- Outcomes directly create customer value
- You have confidence in your product's effectiveness

**Breaks when:**
- Outcomes depend on factors outside your control
- Measurement is disputed ("that lead wasn't from your tool")
- Customers game the metric

**The Hybrid That Usually Wins:**

Platform fee (covers your fixed costs) + usage/outcome variable (scales with value).

Example: $500/month base + $0.05 per transaction (or API call, task completed, record processed — whatever your unit of value is).

Why this works:
- Base fee ensures every customer covers cost to serve
- Variable fee aligns price with value
- Customers can predict minimum spend (base) while scaling naturally
- You capture upside when customers grow

### 3. Freemium Threshold Design (Where Free Ends and Paid Begins)

**The Pattern:**

The hardest pricing decision for developer tools: where do you draw the line between free and paid?

**The Framework: Find the Production Boundary**

Free users who never pay are fine — they create awareness, community, and content. The problem is when *production users* never pay.

**How to Find the Boundary:**

Map your usage distribution:

```
Usage Level          |  User Type        |  Willingness to Pay
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<100 units/mo        |  Hobbyist/learner |  $0 (never paying)
100-1K units/mo      |  Side project     |  $0-20/mo (maybe)
1K-10K units/mo      |  Production use   |  $50-200/mo (will pay)
>10K units/mo        |  Business-critical|  $200-2K/mo (must pay)
```

**Set your free tier limit just below where production usage starts.** In this example: 1,000 units/month free.

Why: Hobbyists and learners stay free (they're your marketing engine). Production users hit the limit naturally and convert (they have budget).

**The Three Types of Free-to-Paid Triggers:**

**1. Usage limit** (most common for platforms)
- Free: 1,000 units/month (API calls, tasks, records, whatever your value unit is)
- Triggers when: Production usage exceeds limit
- Conversion signal: User is building something real

**2. Team/collaboration gate** (best for tools)
- Free: Individual use
- Triggers when: User invites second person
- Conversion signal: Tool is valuable enough to share

**3. Enterprise feature gate** (best for platforms)
- Free: Core features
- Triggers when: Needs SSO, RBAC, audit logs, SLAs
- Conversion signal: IT/security involved (real deployment)

**Common Mistake:**

Setting free tier too high ("we want developers to love us"). If production users don't hit the limit, they never convert. Generosity in free tier should target *learners*, not *production users*.

### 4. Enterprise Pricing (The Conversation, Not the Number)

**The Pattern:**

Enterprise pricing isn't a page on your website. It's a conversation. The "Contact Sales" button exists because enterprise deals have unique requirements — and because you should be pricing based on value, not a menu.

**Enterprise Pricing Variables:**

**1. Deployment model** (self-serve cloud, dedicated cloud, on-prem, hybrid)
- Each has different cost to serve → different price floor
- On-prem commands 2-5x premium over cloud (support complexity)

**2. Usage scale** (seats, API volume, data volume)
- Volume discounts should never go below cost to serve + 40% margin
- Discount off list price, not off already-discounted price

**3. Support level** (community, standard, premium, dedicated)
- Premium support: 1.5-2x base price
- Dedicated CSM: 2-3x base price
- 24/7 support with SLA: 3-5x base price

**4. Compliance requirements** (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP, data residency)
- Each compliance adds real cost (audits, infrastructure, process)
- Price accordingly: 1.5-2x base per compliance standard

**The Enterprise Pricing Conversation:**

When prospect says "what does it cost?":

1. **Don't answer with a number.** Answer with a question: "It depends on your deployment and scale requirements. Help me understand what you need."

2. **Map their requirements:**
   - How many users/seats/units?
   - Cloud or on-prem?
   - Compliance needs?
   - Support expectations?
   - Integration requirements?

3. **Anchor to value before presenting price:**
   - "Based on what you've described, you're currently spending [X] on this problem. Our solution typically reduces that by [Y%]."
   - Then present price as fraction of savings.

4. **Present 3 options:**
   - Good: Meets minimum requirements
   - Better: Meets requirements + nice-to-haves (anchor here)
   - Best: Everything, including things they didn't ask for
   - Most buyers pick Better. That's your real price.

**Common Mistake:**

Publishing enterprise pricing on your website. The moment you publish a number, that's the ceiling — the negotiation only goes down from there. Keep enterprise pricing as a conversation.

### 5. Pricing as Positioning Signal

**The Pattern:**

Your price tells buyers who you're for. This is as much a positioning decision as a revenue decision.

**Price Signals:**

**$0 (Open source / free tier):**
- Signal: We're for developers who want to try before they buy
- Attracts: Individual contributors, experimenters
- Risk: Perceived as "not enterprise-ready"

**$20-100/month:**
- Signal: We're for teams and small businesses
- Attracts: Self-serve buyers, startups
- Risk: Enterprises won't take you seriously (too cheap)

**$500-2,000/month:**
- Signal: We're for production workloads
- Attracts: Growing companies with real budgets
- Risk: Startups priced out (may need free tier)

**$5,000-50,000/year:**
- Signal: We're for enterprises
- Attracts: Mid-market and enterprise
- Risk: Need sales team (can't be self-serve at this price)

**$100K+/year:**
- Signal: We're mission-critical infrastructure
- Attracts: Large enterprises
- Risk: Long sales cycles, heavy support expectations

**The Positioning Test:**

If you price at $50/month but want enterprise customers, your price is undermining your positioning. Enterprise buyers associate low price with low value. You may need to *raise* prices to attract the customers you want.

**Common Mistake:**

Pricing for the customer you have instead of the customer you want. If your roadmap is enterprise, price for enterprise — even if it means losing some SMB customers today.

### 6. When and How to Raise Prices

**Timing Signals:**

- Value ratio > 5x for most customers
- Win rates above 40% (you're not losing on price)
- No customer pushback on pricing in last 6 months
- Customers expanding faster than expected
- Competitors raised prices and didn't lose share

**How to Raise Without Losing Customers:**

**1. Grandfather existing customers** (12-24 months)
- New pricing for new customers only
- Existing customers get notice + timeline
- Creates urgency for prospects ("price is going up")

**2. Add value to justify increase**
- New tier with new features at higher price
- Move current tier features to new higher tier
- This is repositioning, not just a price increase

**3. Annual increase clause in contracts**
- Include 5-10% annual escalator in enterprise contracts
- Normalizes price increases
- Prevents "we've been paying the same for 4 years" conversations

**The Communication:**

"We're investing in [specific improvements]. To continue this level of investment, we're updating our pricing on [date]. Your current plan is locked in at your current rate until [grandfather date]."

Never apologize for raising prices. Frame it as investment in the product they love.

## Decision Trees

### Which Pricing Model?

```
Does usage vary >5x between customers?
├─ Yes → Usage-based (or hybrid with usage component)
└─ No → Continue...
    │
    Does value scale with team size?
    ├─ Yes → Seat-based
    └─ No → Continue...
        │
        Can you measure customer outcomes reliably?
        ├─ Yes → Outcome-based (or hybrid)
        └─ No → Platform fee + feature-based tiers
```

### Should We Raise Prices?

```
Is value ratio > 5x for most customers?
├─ Yes → Raise prices
└─ No → Continue...
    │
    Are win rates > 40%?
    ├─ Yes → Price isn't the problem, but consider raising
    └─ No → Continue...
        │
        Are you losing deals specifically on price?
        ├─ Yes → Don't raise. Improve value or segment better.
        └─ No → Something else is wrong (product, positioning, sales)
```
