# Cloud Design Patterns

Architects design workloads by integrating platform services, functionality, and code to meet both functional and nonfunctional requirements. To design effective workloads, you must understand these requirements and select topologies and methodologies that address the challenges of your workload's constraints. Cloud design patterns provide solutions to many common challenges.

System design heavily relies on established design patterns. You can design infrastructure, code, and distributed systems by using a combination of these patterns. These patterns are crucial for building reliable, highly secure, cost-optimized, operationally efficient, and high-performing applications in the cloud.

The following cloud design patterns are technology-agnostic, which makes them suitable for any distributed system. You can apply these patterns across Azure, other cloud platforms, on-premises setups, and hybrid environments.

## How Cloud Design Patterns Enhance the Design Process

Cloud workloads are vulnerable to the fallacies of distributed computing, which are common but incorrect assumptions about how distributed systems operate. Examples of these fallacies include:

- The network is reliable.
- Latency is zero.
- Bandwidth is infinite.
- The network is secure.
- Topology doesn't change.
- There's one administrator.
- Component versioning is simple.
- Observability implementation can be delayed.

These misconceptions can result in flawed workload designs. Design patterns don't eliminate these misconceptions but help raise awareness, provide compensation strategies, and provide mitigations. Each cloud design pattern has trade-offs. Focus on why you should choose a specific pattern instead of how to implement it.

# Architecture & Design Patterns

## Anti-Corruption Layer Pattern

**Problem**: New systems must integrate with legacy systems that use outdated models or technologies.

**Solution**: Implement a façade or adapter layer between a modern application and a legacy system to prevent legacy constraints from affecting new design.

**When to Use**:
- Migrating from legacy systems incrementally
- Integrating with third-party systems with different domain models
- Protecting modern architectures from legacy constraints

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Create translation layer between domain models
- Map between legacy and modern data structures
- Isolate legacy system interfaces behind abstractions
- Consider performance impact of translation
- Plan for eventual removal if migration is complete

## Backends for Frontends (BFF) Pattern

**Problem**: A single backend may not optimally serve different client types.

**Solution**: Create separate backend services to serve specific frontend applications or interfaces.

**When to Use**:
- Different client types (web, mobile, IoT) have different needs
- Optimizing payload size and shape per client
- Reducing coupling between frontend and shared backend

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Create one BFF per user experience or client type
- Tailor API contracts to frontend needs
- Avoid duplicating business logic across BFFs
- Share common services between BFFs

## Gateway Aggregation Pattern

**Problem**: Clients need data from multiple backend services.

**Solution**: Use a gateway to aggregate multiple individual requests into a single request.

**When to Use**:
- Reducing chattiness between clients and backends
- Combining data from multiple sources for a single view
- Reducing latency by parallelizing backend calls

**Implementation Considerations**:
- API gateway aggregates responses from multiple services
- Execute backend calls in parallel where possible
- Handle partial failures appropriately

- Simplifying service implementation
- Standardizing shared functionality

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Offload SSL termination to gateway
- Implement authentication and authorization at gateway
- Handle rate limiting and throttling

**Solution**: Route requests to multiple services using a single endpoint.

**When to Use**:
- Providing a single entry point for multiple services
- Abstracting backend service topology from clients
- Enabling service versioning and migration strategies

**Implementation Considerations**:

- Support URL rewriting and transformation
- Enable A/B testing and canary deployments
- Implement health checks for backend services
- Monitor routing performance

## Sidecar Pattern

**Problem**: Applications need auxiliary functionality without coupling.

**Solution**: Deploy components of an application into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation.

**When to Use**:
- Adding functionality to applications without modifying them
- Implementing cross-cutting concerns (logging, monitoring, security)
- Supporting heterogeneous environments

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Deploy sidecar alongside main application
- Share lifecycle, resources, and network with main application
- Use for proxying, logging, configuration, or monitoring
- Consider resource overhead of additional containers
- Standardize sidecar implementations across services

## Strangler Fig Pattern

**Problem**: Legacy systems are risky to replace all at once.

**Solution**: Incrementally migrate a legacy system by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services.

**When to Use**:
- Modernizing legacy applications
- Reducing risk of big-bang migrations
- Enabling incremental business value delivery

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Identify functionality to migrate incrementally
- Use facade or proxy to route between old and new

**When to Use**:
- Providing direct access to storage without proxying
- Minimizing data transfer through application tier
- Implementing time-limited or constrained access

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Generate SAS tokens or pre-signed URLs
